## Introduction
In 1971, Leon Chua hypothesized the fourth fundamental circuit component while attempting to build up a missing constitutive relationship between the electrical charge and the
magnetic flux to complete the symmetry. Chua named this speculative nonlinear gadget, memristor (memory + resistor) since it showed the hysteresis property of the-then
ferromagnetic center memory furthermore the dissipative qualities of a resistor. Plainly, in such gadgets, the nonlinear resistance can be remembered inconclusively by controlling the stream of the electrical charge or the magnetic flux. The memristor was proposed to have a memresistance, M and a function defined as dM=Mdq.

## Experiments

First make the PSPICE circuit of the above digram.

MbreakP Specified Parameters:

Setting these values as follows:

DbreakZ as Zener diode with following parameters:

It gave the following shape of pinched hysteresis loop

Curves of Vgs and Id are as follows;

Modifying the above circuit for now as follows;

It gives the following output of pinched hysterics loop;(Capacitor Initial Voltage=-3V)

Curves of Vgs and Id are as follows;

Looking closely why the current is zero from 0.36 secnds to 0.651 seconds lets look at the Vgs and Vds voltage curves (Here Vth=-1V)

Above graph shows that form 0sec to 0.4 sec

So,

Which means that the MOSFET is in Triode/Ohmic region, but after 0.4 sec as Vgs starts dropping from its peak value and falls below Vgs i.e.

Which means it goes into Cut-off region so;

Between vgs â€“ vthh and vds and Id seperate
